				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>The Migraine Prediction Engine is a data-driven research project aimed at leveraging advanced machine
					learning models
					to predict migraine episodes. Conducted across two distinct phases, this project integrates diverse
					data streams,
					including digital biomarkers from wearables, weather variables, and patient-reported digital
					diaries. The ultimate
					goal is to reduce the uncertainty and burden of migraines, enabling patients to take preventive
					measures
					effectively.</p>

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>Migraines represent one of the most debilitating neurological disorders, disproportionately affecting
					women during
					their peak productive years. The unpredictability of migraine episodes exacerbates anxiety and
					significantly impacts
					quality of life. Existing solutions, both prophylactic and abortive, are often insufficient and can
					lead to adverse
					side effects. This project seeks to address these limitations by developing a predictive system that
					combines
					physiological, environmental, and personal data to provide actionable insights for migraine
					sufferers.</p>

				<h2>Situation</h2>
				<p>Traditional methods for migraine management rely heavily on patients identifying and avoiding
					triggers through manual
					logging, which is prone to recall bias. While some digital solutions exist, they often require
					exhaustive user input
					and fail to accommodate the unique migraine patterns of individuals. Furthermore, single-stream
					models lack the
					predictive accuracy needed to mitigate migraine episodes effectively. Our study aims to build a more
					comprehensive,
					personalized approach using state-of-the-art machine learning models.</p>

				<h2>Task</h2>
				<p>Our research was structured in two phases:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Understanding the migraine landscape in a Pakistani context, where
						environmental and
						socio-cultural factors pose additional challenges. This phase involved qualitative research
						through
						semi-structured interviews with migraine patients and healthcare professionals to identify
						common triggers,
						symptoms, and the feasibility of tech-based interventions.</li>
					<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: A more data-intensive in-lab study conducted in Massachusetts, USA,
						focusing on
						developing and validating predictive models using multi-stream data. This phase included the
						deployment of
						wearable devices, the development of a digital diary app, and the integration of weather data.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Action</h2>
				<h3>Phase 1: Qualitative Analysis</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Conducted 13 interviews with migraine patients and 2 with
						doctors to explore
						migraine management practices, identify common triggers, and assess the potential acceptance of
						wearable
						technology in Pakistan.</li>
					<li><strong>Thematic Analysis</strong>: Coded interview transcripts to extract themes related to
						migraine
						perceptions, common symptoms, and barriers to effective management. Key findings indicated a
						preference for
						non-pharmacological treatments and a reluctance to adopt wearable technology due to cultural and
						economic
						factors.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Phase 2: Quantitative Analysis and Model Development</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Data Streams</strong>: Collected over 1,252 hours of wearable data, 733 days of diary
						entries, and two
						years of weather information using Python libraries like <code>scikit-learn</code>,
						<code>PyTorch</code>, and
						<code>TensorFlow</code>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Converted qualitative inputs into machine-readable formats
						using
						techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical data and moving averages for time-series
						imputation.</li>
					<li><strong>Model Training</strong>:
						<ul>
							<li>Employed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) for
								supervised
								learning.</li>
							<li>Trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data to account for
								temporal dependencies,
								using Pythonâ€™s <code>PyTorch</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> for model
								cross-validation.</li>
							<li>Integrated weather variables to understand their impact on migraine onset, using data
								from the
								Weatherbit API.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Voting Mechanism</strong>: Developed a novel voting algorithm to aggregate predictions
						from wearable and
						diary data streams, enhancing model robustness.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Phase 1 Insights</strong>: Identified unique triggers prevalent in Pakistan, such as
						fasting and extreme
						heat, and highlighted the cultural barriers to tech adoption. The thematic analysis provided
						foundational
						knowledge to tailor future interventions.</li>
					<li><strong>Phase 2 Model Performance</strong>: Achieved prediction accuracies between 60% and 73%,
						with lead times
						of 2-8 hours. The LSTM model demonstrated the ability to predict migraine episodes by detecting
						patterns in
						physiological data, stress levels, and weather fluctuations. The use of a harmonic mean to
						combine predictions
						from diary and sensor data improved the system's overall precision.</li>
					<li><strong>Impact</strong>: Demonstrated the potential of personalized predictive models in
						reducing
						migraine-related distress. Emphasized the need for tailored solutions that address both
						individual and cultural
						factors.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>The Migraine Prediction Engine exemplifies the integration of health informatics, machine learning,
					and user-centered
					design. By combining diverse data streams and employing robust statistical models, this project
					paves the way for
					innovative migraine management strategies. Our research underscores the importance of personalized
					healthcare
					solutions and the role of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex medical challenges.</p>
