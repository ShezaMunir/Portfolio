				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>The intricate relationship between real-world events, as captured in news articles, and economic
					indicators is crucial
					for informed decision-making across various sectors. Understanding this dynamic interplay can
					significantly enhance
					economic forecasting, strategic business planning, and trade policy analysis. This project stems
					from the recognition
					that large-scale text data, when analyzed alongside commodity prices and macroeconomic data, can
					reveal valuable
					patterns, correlations, and trends that extend beyond numerical associations, encompassing the
					nuanced narratives that
					shape our economic world.</p>
				<h2>Task</h2>
				<p>We set out to develop an analytical framework to understand the relationship between emerging trends
					from large-scale
					text data, such as news articles, and commodities/macro-economics. Our primary objective was to
					correlate news trends
					with the performance of specific market sectors or assets. This involved analyzing a comprehensive
					dataset of news
					headlines from HuffPost spanning from 2012 to 2018, alongside daily data on wheat prices, crude oil
					prices, and monthly
					unemployment rates.</p>
				<h2>Action</h2>
				<p>We employed a multifaceted approach combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and
					statistical methods. For
					the textual analysis, we utilized NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and
					frequency analysis to
					extract meaningful features from news headlines. We conducted time series analysis to track the
					evolution of keywords
					and themes over time. Statistical methods, including Spearman rank-order correlations and regression
					analyses, were
					applied to investigate relationships between news trends and economic indicators. We also performed
					extensive data
					manipulation, including date format conversions, handling missing data, and joining datasets with
					different timelines.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Our analysis revealed complex relationships between news trends and economic indicators. We found
					strong positive
					correlations between wheat prices, oil prices, and unemployment rates. However, the frequency of
					economy-related
					keywords in news headlines showed only weak correlations with actual commodity prices. This suggests
					that while economic
					indicators are closely interrelated, news reporting may not always accurately reflect economic
					realities. Our regression
					models demonstrated significant relationships between these variables, with up to 82.6% of
					unemployment rate variability
					explained by wheat and oil prices. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics
					between news sentiment and
					economic factors, while also highlighting the importance of cautious interpretation when inferring
					causation from
					correlation in economic analyses.</p>
