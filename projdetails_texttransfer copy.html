				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>The challenge of text style transfer, particularly between writing styles, presents a
					significant opportunity for advancing natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project
					addresses the
					complexities of non-parallel data in style transfer tasks, a persistent issue in the field where
					equivalent sentences in
					different styles are not readily available. By focusing on the works of Jane Austen as a
					representative of classical
					literature, we explore innovative solutions to this problem. The motivation stems from the potential
					applications of
					such technology in content generation, translation, and improving the accessibility of historical
					texts to modern
					readers. Furthermore, we are driven by the prospect of leveraging state-of-the-art language models
					to generate synthetic
					parallel datasets, a novel approach to overcome the scarcity of parallel data in style transfer
					tasks. This method not
					only contributes to the broader field of computational linguistics but also opens new avenues for
					cultural heritage
					preservation in the digital age. By developing techniques to create high-quality synthetic datasets,
					we aim to enhance
					the performance and generalizability of style transfer models, potentially revolutionizing how we
					approach non-parallel
					text style transfer problems across various domains and time periods.</p>
				<h2>Task</h2>
				<p>Our primary task was to develop an effective method for bidirectional text style transfer between
					classical and
					contemporary English, using Jane Austen's works as our source material. This involved overcoming the
					challenge of
					non-parallel data, where equivalent sentences in different styles are not explicitly paired. We
					aimed to create a model
					capable of generating text in Austen's style and transforming it into modern English while
					preserving semantic meaning.
					We sought to explore innovative approaches to generate synthetic parallel data to enhance the
					performance
					of our style transfer models.</p>
				<h2>Action</h2>
				<p>We implemented a multi-stage approach to tackle this task. Initially, we fine-tuned the GPT-2 model
					on Jane Austen's
					works to generate text in her authorial style. To address the non-parallel nature of our data, we
					employed an innovative
					technique using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate parallel text by transforming Austen's
					writing into modern
					English. This synthetic parallel dataset was crucial in overcoming the limitations of non-parallel
					data. We then
					developed a BARTForConditionalGeneration model for bidirectional text style transfer, combining data
					from Project
					Gutenberg with our augmented parallel dataset. Throughout the process, we utilized advanced NLP
					techniques such as
					tokenization, sequence-to-sequence modeling, and fine-tuning of pre-trained language models.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Our approach yielded promising results in achieving seamless text style transfer between classical
					and contemporary
					styles. The fine-tuned BART model demonstrated significant improvements over baseline methods,
					achieving higher
					BERTScore metrics (precision: 0.9202, recall: 0.9384, F1 score: 0.9291) and a low perplexity score
					of 1.8308. These
					results indicate that our model effectively captures the nuances of both classical and contemporary
					writing styles while
					maintaining semantic coherence. The synthetic parallel data generated using GPT-3.5-Turbo proved
					instrumental in
					enhancing the model's performance, addressing the challenge of non-parallel data in style transfer
					tasks. Our work
					contributes to the advancement of style transfer techniques in NLP, particularly in handling
					non-parallel data, and
					opens up new possibilities for applications in literary analysis, content adaptation, and historical
					text modernization.</p>
